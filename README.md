# Geotab Development Assessment

As part of your application to Geotab, we ask that you complete the following challenge.

## Instructions

This application has the following requirements:
- The user can choose to generate between 1 and 9 (inclusive) unique jokes.
- The user can optionally specify a joke category from a curated list of categories.

We would like you to:
- Make this application **production ready**.
- Write a document (or add to the Readme file) explaining the changes you made, and why you did so.

Note: We are attempting to discern your capabilities at producing high quality and production ready work / code. Thus, it is more important you do a thorough job than a quick job. (Rushing through it won't bring any advantage, so take as much time as you need to do it well)

## How to Run

Run the Api by executing `dotnet run` in the MyApi directory.

Run the App by executing `npm start` in the my-app directory. Note: before running this the first time you will need to run `npm install`.

## How to Submit

To submit the your challenge please follow the steps below:
- Download and unzip the project folder to your local machine.
- Make your changes and write a document explaining the changes you made.
- Send us back a zip archive of the project folder with your changes along with your document.

Please contact your Geotab recruiter if you have any questions, and good luck!
